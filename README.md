Expat guide to ${COUNTRY} like I'm five
=====================================

Moving to another country is always hard - if you don't know anyone there and/or don't speak the language,
it's twice as hard! 

In the internet age, the information is often abundant, but sometimes, you don't even know
what to look for, and sometimes, Google Translate is just not good enough. This is why this repo was created, to ***help you understand all the important details when considering
migrating to a new country***.

The aim of this repo is to give an overview of all the important aspects of life in a country
as an expat, and to ***be able to compare between different countries***.

Each country is just a one file, with all the info described briefly, but with some
basic details, sample data points etc., and with accompanying links for further reading.

Contributing guide
------------------

Descriptions should be written in an objective, non-biased way.

The main idea is that ***each file should be written without any assumptions, and emphasising
any major non-obvious things***, so that someone who never lived in a country can get a clear
picture of the situation. Anything that you personally consider non-obvious after moving in is a good subject to cover!

You're welcome to share personal observation from your experience. Whenever possible, try to include a link to relevant reading (if possible, in English, and/or to an official governmental website), but we're not Wikipedia (yet), so we won't put *[citation needed]* if there's no link.

Try to use some keywords (names of insitutions etc.) in the local language, to make it easier for the interested persons to find more data on the topic. 

**If you lived in some country as an expat, or you're a native who can contribute, we're looking for a pull request from you!**

If you have some ideas that you wanted to discuss prior to opening a pull request, feel invited to do so by opening an issue!
