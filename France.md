Expat guide to FRANCE like I'm five
===================================


France might not be the hottest location for migrating when looking for an IT job, but it has its advantages.


Getting hired without knowing the language
==========================================

In big, international technology companies, you can get hired without knowing French.
In smaller companies and outside of technology sector, it's rather hard.

If you migrate with your partner who doesn't speak French and does not have a sough-after academic degree,
it might be very difficult for them to find work in France, unless they learn the language AND get a degree in France
(many French employees are very conservative and they often value degrees more than experience and skills).

Working hours and holidays
==========================

Work week
---------

According to the law, normal work week is 35h. However, in technology sector, it's common to work 37.5h
per week, and due to that, you get extra holidays (so called RTT days).

Vacation policy
---------------

Typically you get about 30-35 days off per year, apart from official bank holidays (which are plenty in May).
This depends on the company, and also the number of bank holidays in a given year which fall on Saturdays/Sundays.

Office hours
------------

The typical office hours (in the south) are 9:00 - 12:00 and 14:00 - 18:30 
or 8:00 - 12:00 and 14:00 - 17:30 (note the 2h lunch break!)

Overtime
--------

Generally, you're not paid for the overtime - unless you do very significant overtime, on **explicit demand** of the company.

Visas
=====

If you're not an EU-national, you'll need a visa.

Salaries
========

In France, as a programmer, you get a relatively high starting salary, and then the salary progression is rather slow.

You receive a bank transfer to your account at the end of each month (typically, last day of the month,
sometimes a day or two earlier if a month ends on a weekend / holiday).

Salary bands
-------------

In big companies with strong unions typically there are salary bands depending on which "level" you are
(level is generally related to your experience and tenure at the company) and it might be difficult to negotiate
salary out of band, without getting approved for a higher level.

Raises
------

In some very big companies, get an "automatic" yearly raise of about 1-2%.
In most mid-sized companies however, you should be proactive and tell your manager/director that you want a raise.
In some companies the committee which approves raises might meet only several times per year, you should learn
about when they do so, and plan asking for a raise with advance.

Salaries by area
================

The salaries quoted below are the salaries you get on your job contracts, before social security and taxes.

Paris, Sophia Antipolis (top paid locations in France)
----------------------

Typical junior dev salary: €35k-€40k

Typical 5-year-exp dev salary: €40k-€50k

Remote work
===========

Big French companies are generally still reluctant to remote work. You might face hostility or straight "no"
at company level or from your manager towards the idea.

When a company allows remote work, it's usually very strictly regulated (example: "once a week, on Tuesdays").
Usually you need a year or more tenure at the team to be eligible.


Taxes
=====

The main tax you pay is the income tax, however, there are several more taxes you have to pay, which might not be obvious!

Income tax
----------

As of 2016, you pay the income tax with one year delay (it's not automatically deducted from your pay). For instance, when you moved in to France in 2016,
you'd pay your tax only in middle-2017, in one batch.

**However this system is going to change in 2017/2018: your employer will be automatically deducting estimated tax money from
each paycheck, every month.**

**Note that you pay the tax from *net imposable* (taxable income) of your household**,
not the number that you have on your job contract. Some parts of the salary, like social security charges, are not taxable.

Example: If your job contract says "€40.000", the *net imposable* (after social charges) of it will be typically slighly below €30.000.

*Net imposable* is not exactly equal to the amount you receive on your bank account, but usually it's close to it. With €40.000 brut salary, you'll get around €2.500 each month on your bank account (but still, subject to income tax at the end of the year).

Once you sum the *net imposable* of all the household members, you divide that number by no. of "parts" in your household.

`final_base_of_taxation = sum_of_all_adults(net_imposable) / parts`

Each adult and child count as 1 part, except 1st and 2nd child, who count as 0.5.

Example: married with 3 children => `parts = 4 (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1)`

Once you calculate your final base of taxation, you apply the numbers from the tax rates table to calculate final tax amount.
The tax bands are progressive, with the following approx. rates of 2016 (numbers rounded for clarity):

          €0 -   €9.700  0%
      €9.700 -  €27.000 14%
     €27.000 -  €71.000 30%
     €71.000 - €151.000 41%
    €151.000 +          45%

Example: married with 2 children (parts = 3), sum of taxable incomes of €30.000 => final base of taxation = €10.000, final tax = 14% * (10000-9700)

Example: married with 1 child (parts = 2.5), sum of taxable incomes of €50.000 => final base of taxation = €20.000, final tax = 14%* (20000-9700)

Example: single (parts = 1), taxable income of €30.000 => final base of taxation = €30.000, final tax = 14%* (27000-9700) + 30% * (30000-27000)

Apartment tax (*Taxe d'habitation*)
-----------------

When you rent an apartment, you pay a local tax for it (apart from the monthly rent). According to law, as a tenant you pay the tax if you lived in an apartment on 1st of January (otherwise, the owner pays)

The tax is a local tax, but it's collected by the state Tax Office, around October each year (quite a delay!).

The amount of this tax varies based on a city and even a district of the city. Usually it's about 80-150% of a monthly rent fee.

Since the cut-off date is January 1st, if you come to France in the winter, you should either defer your arrival or rental of an apartment until after January 1st (or agree with the owner that they pay). If you change apartment, it could be also beneficial to do it around 1st January, if you have a colleague who can keep you and your things over the New Year's Eve :)

"TV tax" (*Contribution à l'audiovisuel public*)
-------------------------------------

If you own a TV set, you have to pay the "TV tax". In 2016 the fee was 137€. 

You do it at the same time as *taxe d'habitation*.

Health
======

Health system overview
----------------------

Healthcare in France is of a very high quality, and very accessible.
It's a mixed public-private system.

You get basic public insurance from CPAM (state organisation), and a complementary private insurance
from so called "mutuelles" (which is not strictly obligatory by law, but generally almost every person has it).

Typically your employer will offer to pay a large part of your mutuelle as a part of compensation package.

When you're subscribed to public insurance and have a mutuelle, the hospital care, and blood tests
in the private labs, and some other things are generally free of charge.

General practitioners and specialists (dentists etc.) typically have private practices, where you pay for a visit
upfront (by cash or cheque), then you get reimbursed by CPAM and your mutuelle, by bank transfers.

It's advisable to choose a GP, and consult your GP first before going to specialists;
if you don't have a referral from GP, you might not get reimbursed for the visit.
(This does not concern dentists, ophtalmologists, gynaecologists, and psychiatrists, to whom you can go directly).

Once you're signed up to the public system, you will obtain a *"Carte Vitale"* (chip-based card, size of credit card),
which you use when seeing doctors, at the pharmacies etc. which takes care of transmitting data to CPAM and a mutuelle
so that you can get automatic reimbursements (*"télétransmission"*)

Obtaining your Carte Vitale can take a while... up to several months! During this time you're still entitled
to all healthcare, but you must collect all the papers (so called *"feuille de soins"*) and send them to CPAM and
mutuelle each time to get your money back.

Healthcare costs
----------------

Generally, due to the *de-facto* system where not-so-low social charges and mutuelle subscription are deducted
from each person's paycheck, you don't pay much for the healthcare on top of it, considering the level of service
you get in exchange, and the salaries. The only exceptions are the things that are considered purely esthetic
(orthodontic treament, implants, laser eye corrections). 

For visiting a GP you'll typically pay 23€ (as of 2016), but after reimbursement from CPAM and mutuelle,
the final cost will be just 1€ (the fixed non-reimbursamble fee).

For visiting a specialist, you might pay around 50-70€, reimbursement vary on your mutuelle.

For visiting a dentist, for a simple visit, you pay around 50-70€, reimbursement vary on your mutuelle.
Complex things (crowns, implants) are expensive (1000€+) and only partially reimbursable;
here it pays off to have a good mutuelle which has attractive dental reimbursement rules.

Glasses: both glasses and frames in France are very expensive, be prepared to pay €300 or more.
However, typically each mutuelle package has a generous coverage of this, and all in all
you can get a new pair of glasses for free once a year or two (details vary).


If you have a pre-existing medical condition
--------------------------------------------

Everyone is accepted to the public and private system regardless of their health,
and the amount you pay to the social security or a mutuelle is not linked to your health state.

When you have a severe long-term (chronic) illness, with an expensive treatment required,
your doctor can apply for you to obtain you ALD status
(*"affection de longue durée"*). If it's approved, you don't pay at all for any medications
and treatments linked to that sickness.


Apartment rental
================

Before moving in, you pay a deposit which is usually equal one-month rent.

In touristic areas, it might be tricky to rent an appartment when you arrive in the summer - 
many landlords try to rent apartments privately to tourists at this time, and there can be few long-term offers.

Most of the rentals take place through agencies ("immobiliers"), but sometimes you can also rent directly
from the owner ("particulier").

There's a rent control put in place, and the landlords can raise your rent only once per year,
by a fixed percentage, calculated by the government each year based on inflation (typically, 1-3% recently).

Apartment rental rules are rather well regulated, some details depend on whether you rent a furnished
or non-furnished apartment.

Public transport
================

Due to ongoing labour law changes, France is subject to very frequent strikes of public transport (bus drivers, train drivers, airline/airport crews, air traffic controllers...) as well as taxi drivers raging against Uber. Brace yourself!

Côte d'Azur
-----------

Public transport (buses) is quite cheap and the network is big; however, delays are often, as well as the strikes. Trains are less cheap but still affordable.

It's tricky to commute between nearby cities at night. Often the last train departs around 22h00!

First weeks in the country
==========================

Dealing with French bureaucracy can be a bit intimidating, especially at the beginning. Generally the French system is not optimized for handling non-French-born people, to put it nicely - certain things like obtaining a *Carte Vitale*, opening a bank account for the first time, installing internet etc. are tricky and take some time. But once it's done, everything generally works fine.
 

Other important things you should know
======================================

Job market, unions, contracting agencies
---------------------

France has very strong unions and very stiff work law, both of which influence the job market.
The trial period lasts 4 months + optional 3 more months, and companies usually take advantage of it.
After those 7 months, once a worker gets a permanent contract, it's very hard to fire them
(for poor performance etc.), essentially impossible, except from worker's misconduct, or company being
on the verge of bankruptcy.

A local phenomenon which stems from the stiff laws is the one of "contracting companies".
Contrary to the contracting market elsewhere, the "contracts" in France are typically long and can last for years.

In this scheme, you're hired in a contracting company A and sent for a "mission" to a company B. 
Typically, a big company B will hire some 20-50% of workforce as "contractors" so that they can terminate their
missions when they're not needed anymore, otherwise it would have been hard to terminate them if they were staff.
Company A takes the premium for the risk they're taking by hiring someone.

For the worker, the scheme is not so good, because as a "contractor":

- your salary is similar or lower than if you were hired directly at company B
- you're not entitled to various perks and bonuses of company B
- you're not entitled to attending trainings, conferences etc.
- you might not have access to internal opportunities at company B
- very often **it's difficult to become staff once hired as a contractor**, no matter how long you
work there

When talking to a recruiter from this kind of "contracting agency", be aware of this!

Some international companies have significantly reduced their workforce in France lately
or are planning to do so, due to high costs of work, stiff work laws,
and other reasons (examples: Texas Instruments, Nvidia, Intel).
